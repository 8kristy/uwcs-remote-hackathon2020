The 2020 season was originally scheduled to begin on March 26. MLB joined other U.S. sports leagues in suspending league activities in mid-March in order to comply with shelter-in-place orders and bans on mass gatherings.
Under normal circumstances, fans are generally limited to ticket swaps or credits in the event that an MLB game can’t be played due to rain or other obstacles. MLB teams don’t typically offer ticket refunds.
However, sports leagues have faced criticism in recent days for failing to refund ticket purchases as a time when many Americans are out of work or contending with financial hardships due to the pandemic. Most MLB teams have had about 20 percent of their home schedules postponed during the crisis, with no guarantee that the full schedule will be played this year.
The stoppage has cost MLB teams and franchises in other sports millions of dollars in expected revenue from ticket sales and other sources. Several franchises have enacted executive pay cuts and other cost-cutting measures. 
MLB is exploring multiple scenarios to play out the full 162-game schedule this year, including the possibility of sending all teams to play games in Arizona or Florida and extending the season deeper into the fall. President Trump and Dr. Anthony Fauci have each suggested that U.S. sports will likely resume without fans in attendance at games.
