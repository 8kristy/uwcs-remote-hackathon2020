Swift has been beefing with her former record label, Big Machine Records, since last summer when it was reportedly sold for $300 million to a group including record executive Scooter Braun, who she has accused of bullying her.
“It looks to me like Scooter Braun and his financial backers, 23 Capital, Alex Soros and the Soros family and The Carlyle Group have seen the latest balance sheets and realized that paying $330 MILLION for my music wasn’t exactly a wise choice and they need money,” Swift wrote in the Instagram post.

“So tasteless, but very transparent,” she wrote.
In February, Swift signed a publishing agreement with Universal Music Publishing Group. The deal will cover new work she produces and eventually cover her full catalog once Sony/ATV Music Publishing’s rights to older songs expires, The New York Times reported.
