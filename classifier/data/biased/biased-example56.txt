The program will be available in Alabama, Arizona, California, Florida, Idaho, Iowa, Kentucky, Nebraska, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Washington, West Virginia and Missouri where more than half of U.S. households rely on federal funding for food.
Electronic benefit transfer (EBT) cards can be used to buy groceries from participating retailers. Amazon and Walmart are currently offering the service in Florida, New York, Iowa, Nebraska, Alabama, Oregon and Washington state.

To qualify for SNAP benefits, a person must earn a gross monthly income at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty line -- though eligibility requirements can vary by state.
