Businesses in some states, like Georgia, have begun the process of reopening. However, it is not business as usual. Owners are being asked to implement social distancing guidelines, provide personal protective equipment to their workers and to provide extra time off for individuals should they need to self-isolate. 
These measures are designed to protect both staff and customers.
“Can your small mom and pop do that? Do they have the technology to do that? I fear that they don’t,” Rosenstrauch said.
Small mom and pop nail salons and barbershops, for example, may not currently have the technology to allow customers to book appointments online – which will likely be necessary due to pent-up demand and social distancing guidelines limiting the number of people permitted in a space.
Anecdotally, Rosenstrauch noted that an individual in the service industry said providing shields and masks, as well as reducing and changing worker shifts, will increase company costs by 15 percent.
Further, businesses will be missing out on revenue due to the sheer fact that they will not be allowed to fill their establishments.
“You might just have some business owners saying … ‘I’m just not going to reopen,’” Rosenstrauch said.
Ultimately, states and localities will be responsible for determining their own guidance. However, should businesses be unwilling – or unable – to comply with the most rigorous health and safety standards, it remains to be seen how keen customers will be to return to the establishments.
“Safety is going to be important to every shopper at this point,” Rosenstrauch said. “Smaller companies are going to have to do this.”
