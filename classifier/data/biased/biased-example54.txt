"Although I've been banned, I'm glad to see you have the courage to have me on," Giuliani joked with Bartiromo. "The reason they want me to be silenced is not because I'm unhinged. It's because I have facts ... I've got a lot of affidavits, statements, even video tapes."
Giuliani said he was looking into Ukraine becase of its role in the leadup to the special cousnel Russia investigation, not for a 2020 edge. When Bartiromo asked whether he should have spoken up about the Bidens' alleged corruption earlier, he laughed.
"I brought it out in March, I brought it out in April, I brought it out in May. I wrote about it, tweeted about it," Giuliani said.
He accused the media of being corrupt and complicit in a coverup.
