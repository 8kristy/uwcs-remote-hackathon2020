Congressmen Turned Radio Host, Joe Walsh, Recklessly Talks Muskets If Trump Loses
link This guy didn't even win re-election but he think's he's got a mandate of some sort to take up arms if the candidate he supports doesn't win in November? Link to Tweet : Wreckless, self-serving, self-aggrandizing, illiberal, undemocratic, moronic and contrary to the very rule of law his candidate purports to stand for when he's not ginning up cancerous fantasies among the froathy-mouthed sheep who fancy themselves as revolutionaries akin to the American colonists (muskets? lol. Okay Alex Jones). No Joe. You're just an asshole blathering about civil war if your pick of leader doesn't win the day. There's nothing laudable about that. Unbelievable how carelessly people like Walsh are yapping about something that could result in millions of dead people and the end to America as we know it. Make Trump President Or Else?
