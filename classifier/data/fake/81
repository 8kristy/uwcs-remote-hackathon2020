UFO over the East Valley here in AZ last night. page: 1 link I couldn't take any pictures I live in West Mesa and the lights were way East. Over Queen Creek area. Lots of my friends and family started calling me right when the lights started happening so I went out to my balcony and there they were. Some people got some pretty good videos. I know some people will say they are flares from a plane but if they are flares why do they dispensary right away. Typically if its a flare it will stay ignited for a short period of time. Kinda nuts. I only witnessed the later 3 lights when it was dark out. It was pretty cool to see and stopped soon after it started. What does ATS think??? edit on 26-10-2016 by PraetorianAZ because: (no reason given)
