DONALD TRUMP SKIPS MEDIA: Delivers Transition Update Straight To The People [Video] Audience members booed Pence as he entered the theater and after the cast’s curtain call, the statement was read. Cast member Brandon Dixon stopped Pence on his way out of the performance to publicly shame him in front of the audience and cast members of Hamilton. Dixon’s message was written by show creator Lin-Manuel Miranda, director, Thomas Kail and lead producer, Jeffrey Seller, according to the New York Times. ‘We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights. We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us,’ Dixon said, reading the message aloud. But cast members were able to give input. RadarOnline investigated whether or not the actors had voted and revealed many leads hadn’t in years. Dixon’s records show he didn’t vote during president Obama’s reelection bid in 2012. Javier Munoz, playing the titular role of Hamilton, registered to vote in 2006 and voted in the mid-term elections, but hasn’t been on record as voting since. 
Seth Stewart, who plays Thomas Jefferson, voted in 2008 when Obama ran for the first time. He did not vote in 2012. Okieriete “Oak” Onaodowan, who players James Madison and Hercules Mulligan, registered to vote in 2005 but hasn’t been on record voting since. Since the clash with the Hamilton cast, Pence told Fox News he wasn’t offended by the message and said the booing ‘is what freedom sounds like’. – Daily Mail
