To pander to Hispanics Hillary states some whoppers on Univision
To pander to Hispanics Hillary states some whoppers on Univision page: 1 link Ah, Hillary. You change your accent depending on who you talk to. You tell Blacks in an interview you carry hot sauce everywhere. You try to appeal to Native Americans with Elizabeth Warren (hahahaha) but for her this is a low. USing her own grandchild....it isn't the first time she has used the grandchild either. It was the excuse for Bill and Loretta also... Link First, when asked, she says her favorite food is Mexican. In an article this year for “Thrillist,” detailing her favorite restaurants in the state of the New York, Clinton listed Rao’s (Italian), Northern Lights Creamery (gelato ice cream), Lange’s Little Store (sandwiches), Charlie The Butcher’s (meat) and others. But she didn’t list a single Mexican establishment. Second, she went on to tell the hosts her 2 y/o granddaughter is learning Spanish. Really? I mean she should have walked on stage with an El Chapo t-shirt, a sombrero and a six pack of Sol for goodness sake. Now, i know, this is not a big deal but stop and think. She is pathological. Is that who we really want in the White House? Someone who will say ANYTHING to ANYBODY in order to get them to agree. Using your grandchild to pander to a voting block. She is Nasty. If I was HIspanic this may not drive me to vote Trump, even though they should and will, I certainly would not vote for someone as fake as she is. Only good thing was she got a bottle of Tequila for her birthday. I am sure Bills foot massagers in his library will love it.... edit on 10pm31pmf 2016-10-26T14:56:02-05:000202 by matafuchs because: (no reason given) edit on 10pm31pmf 2016-10-26T14:57:05-05:000205 by matafuchs because: (no reason given)
