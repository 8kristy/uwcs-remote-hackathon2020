yet another proof of wrong touchscreen calibration
yet another proof of "wrong touchscreen calibration" page: 1 now, i don't agree with their claim about such equipment not needing a calibration - touchscreen devices need it, but this really had to be done on purpose to favor one side and not the other. "coincidence", you say. if someone can grab it and upload it to youtube, that would be great - it may disappear from 4chan. i don't have the link for that thread there, but judging by the names on the screen, it's from Virginia. yet another place. Somehow ATS will not let me upload a GIF. But here: damn, i've jumped the bandwagon. mods, 404 or hoax it, that video isn't from 2016. a reply to: jedi_hamster Aah... Then so am I . Damn.. And I promised myself to stay out of this political garbage... I now know why.. edit on 26-10-2016 by EartOccupant because: (no reason given) damn, i've jumped the bandwagon. mods, 404 or hoax it, that video isn't from 2016. Hi JH, how do you know its not from 2016? just curious as i am not in that neck of the woods Thanks now, i don't agree with their claim about such equipment not needing a calibration - touchscreen devices need it, but this really had to be done on purpose to favor one side and not the other.

Direct link EDIT: This video was actually taken back in 2014 in Virginia, during the 2014 congressional elections (see it on YouTube here.) The reason listed for the issues that arose in the video was a calibration error; not entirely out of the realms of possibility given the number of touchscreen devices used during the elections across the United States that year. edit on 26-10-2016 by kelbtalfenek because: more information and a quote
