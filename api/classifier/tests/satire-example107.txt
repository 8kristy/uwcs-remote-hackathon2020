Sony Announces Discreet New Flesh-Colored VR Helmet That Blends In With Your Face
Looks like the future of virtual reality has finally arrived. Sony just announced their new flesh-colored VR helmet that seamlessly blends in with your face, letting you play inconspicuously anywhere, anytime. For anyone worried about sticking out in public after booting Superhot VR or Five Nights At Freddy’s VR: Help Wanted, the PlayStation VR Flesh headset seems like the perfect solution, offering a subtle design in multiple skin tones for a mere $199.99.
“Unlike the distractingly artificial aesthetic of previous headsets, the PSVR Flesh looks just like a neutral human face, allowing you to play a game wherever you go without drawing undue attention,” said Sony Interactive president Jim Ryan, explaining how the headset’s design helps users keep their VR experience going while out and about by incorporating highly realistic eyes and a range of flesh-like textures. “Whether you’re stuck in the waiting room at the doctor’s office, on your daily commute, or having dinner with family, the discreet skin-colored frame lets you fully immerse yourself in the exciting world of virtual reality with the confidence of knowing you’ll never look out of place.”
“Plus, the system comes bundled with a set of hand controls designed to look like you’re giving two big thumbs-up,” he added.
Keep your eyes peeled. With presales already topping 200,000 mere hours after its announcement, expect to start seeing (or not seeing!) the PSVR Flesh on gamers’ faces everywhere by the end of the year.
