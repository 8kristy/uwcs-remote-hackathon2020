Here’s Everything We Know So Far About ‘Super Mario 64’
If you’ve got questions about Nintendo’s flagship Mario game for the N64, you’ve come to the right place, because we’re breaking down everything we know so far about Super Mario 64.
Although Nintendo has kept quiet about the platformer in recent months, we’ve recently managed to learn some tantalizing details about it. First, let’s get to the basics: Super Mario 64 features our favorite Italian plumber on a familiar quest to defeat Bowser and save Princess Peach. It also sounds like fans of the NES and SNES Mario games will be right at home, as we’re likely to see the return of villains such as Goombas, Boos, and Koopa-Troopas as well as allies like Toad (and maybe even a surprise appearance by Yoshi!).
But here’s where things get crazy: Nintendo developers revealed that Super Mario 64 features three-dimensional gameplay for the first time in the series’ history. That means you can say goodbye to side-scrolling and hello to huge, open-world areas. Here’s hoping the iconic character we know and love is still as fun to play in 3D!
Besides that, we’ve seen gameplay footage that suggests Mario has a variety of new moves such as double-jumps, long jumps, and backflips, and even more abilities when he wears a series of power-granting hats. We’ve also heard rumors that there’s a level with a timed-racing portion. Lastly—and take this with a grain of salt—it sounds like much of the game will take place inside an enormous castle that serves as a hub level.
Alright, that’s all we know right now about Super Mario 64, but keep checking back for the latest news. We’re excited to learn even more in the coming months!
