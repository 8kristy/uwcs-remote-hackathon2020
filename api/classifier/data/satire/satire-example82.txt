Deal Alert: Your Parents Have Promised To Buy You ‘Let’s Go Pikachu’ If You Can Make It Through Rosh Hashanah This Year Without Biting Anyone
If you’ve been dying to play Pokémon: Let’s Go Pikachu but have been holding off because of the price tag, we’ve got a deal you’re definitely going to want to check out: Your parents are giving away a new copy of the popular Switch game if you can make it through all of Rosh Hashanah this year without biting anyone.
This is an offer that’s just too good to pass up!
The Switch remake of the classic Game Boy Pokémon adventure normally retails for $59.99, but it could be yours for FREE if you can just restrain your inexplicable urges for the entirety of the high holiday. So how do you redeem it? It’s simple! All you have to do is be a nice, normal kid for both nights of the Jewish new year, one who doesn’t bite their cousins like last year, and your parents will stop at Target on the way home from your uncle’s house to get you the game.
While we know you’ve been having a hard time keeping your teeth to yourself lately, Let’s Go Pikachu is a game you’ve been asking for since last year, and it would be a shame to mess this amazing deal up by latching onto your aunt’s arm and refusing to let go. We don’t want a repeat of what you did to grandma when she kissed you during Purim, okay?
And as if this deal wasn’t good enough, your parents have said that you can chow down on as many apples and honey as you want as long as you don’t use those chompers on any family members this time. So what are you waiting for? This is your last chance to collect on this offer, so act now by taking your little brother’s fingers out of your mouth!
