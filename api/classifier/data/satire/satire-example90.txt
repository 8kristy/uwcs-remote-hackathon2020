‘Madden NFL 20’ Debuts Three New Romanceable Kickers
Madden NFL 20 drops today and it looks like there is exciting news connected to one of the most popular aspects of the long-running football video game franchise. According to the game’s creators, EA Sports has added three new romanceable kickers to the game’s career mode!
We don’t know about you, but we don’t think we’ll be able to pick a favorite among all these cute new players!
“We know our fans consider romance to be one of the most fun and important parts of any Madden game, which is why we are so happy to reveal Kyle, Andre, and Tony to the world,” said EA Sports vice president Daryl Holt. “Kyle is a cute single dad who is really devoted to his kids. Tony may seem shy at first but he is really deep and emotional when you get to know him. And Andre is a classic bad boy whose tough exterior hides a heart of gold.”
Players can get to know each of the three new kickers, as well as the sixteen other dateable punters from previous years, by engaging in dialogue like flirting or flattering, going on dates to the local movie theater and aquarium, or bringing them gifts like wine, suits, and buffalo wings. Just make sure you choose the right move for every kicker’s unique personality because if you try and joke with pensive Tony right before a big kick, it could really backfire!
It’s great to see EA Sports committed to adding more and better content year after year to its flagship franchise. Based on fan reactions, Kyle, Andre, and Tony are all on their way to becoming fan favorites and are sure to steal the hearts of players all over the world. And hey, if you’re really lucky, one of them might even end up asking you to the yearly NFL dance at the Raspberry Blossom Festival!
