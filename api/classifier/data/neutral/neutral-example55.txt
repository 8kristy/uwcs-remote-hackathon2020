Virgin Media goes offline for thousands
Virgin Media, one of the UK's largest broadband providers, has gone offline for thousands of users.
Intermittent outages began just after 17:00 BST on Monday, coinciding with the government daily coronavirus press briefing.
The Downdetector service recorded more than 30,000 reports - some said service resumed quickly but others reported ongoing issues hours later.
Virgin said the problem was fixed as of Tuesday morning.
A Virgin Media spokesman told the BBC on Tuesday the issue "saw broadband drop for a minute or so every hour or two and then restore".
"We identified the problem and it's now fixed as of earlier this morning. This wasn't a constant loss of service, it was intermittent," he added. The firm believes the problem was caused "by a technical fault in our core network".
Some users had reported brief outages continuing into the early hours, causing problems for services - such as customer service chats and online video games - which require a persistent connection.
Virgin Media's website had estimated problems would not be fixed until Tuesday morning for some UK postcodes.
Downdetector indicates that other UK broadband providers - including Sky, BT, TalkTalk and Vodafone - experienced problems for a brief time shortly after midnight, but it is not known whether this was related to Virgin's problem.
Staff and residents of care homes in England, and over-65s, can now be tested, the health secretary says.
