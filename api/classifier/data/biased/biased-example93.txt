“It also uses reflective technology to ensure that the entire device, or whatever is put inside, is being sanitized on all sides,” Barnes told FOX Business’ Stuart Varney.
Barnes said they were not prepared for the influx in demand, causing a backorder on products. PhoneSoap’s new wireless device, Barnes announced, is available now to pre-order and will be ready to ship April 30. 
“We’re seeing a lot of demand and a lot of success,” he said. “The demand is surging, obviously something we were not fully prepared for… but we do believe it’s an important part of the solution.”
