Witherspoon bought the under-construction property in 2014 for $12.7 million, records show. She reportedly tried to sell it for closer to $20 million in 2016 but didn’t find a buyer.
The 10,300-square-foot home includes five bedrooms and seven bathrooms, according to county property records. There’s a large backyard with a pool, but few other details about the home are available as it’s never been publicly listed since it was built in 2014.
One Instagram post shows off the modern kitchen, with subway tile backsplash, white marble countertops and a chef’s stove/oven.
Large built-in bookshelves and wide-beam hardwood floors appear in another post.
Other posts show what appears to be parts of a sizeable walk-in dressing room and master bath or vanity.
Of course, the sale doesn’t mean that Witherspoon’s Hollywood days are behind her. She reportedly purchased another home in Malibu last year.
