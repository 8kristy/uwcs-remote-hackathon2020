"So far, we’ve processed an amazing 450,000 loans totaling over $50 billion," Trump said. "Demand is extraordinarily high and there are already twice as many users accessing the system as on any day under the first round."
According to Trump, the SBA has handled "30 percent more loans than any previous day of the program."

In the first round of the PPP, Trump said more than 1.6 million small businesses received over $340 billion of federal aid to ensure American workers could "retain their jobs, receive their paychecks, and help our economy take off quickly once America reopens for business"
"Our swift action supported or saved 30 million American jobs at least," Trump added.
Companies will have until May 7 to pay back the loans they received from the SBA, and the returned PPP funds will be redispersed to small businesses in the second round of funding, according to the Treasury.
