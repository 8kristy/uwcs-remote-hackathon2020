Jones’ setup drew immediate interest from NFL Draft viewers when he appeared on live stream for the fully virtual event on Thursday night. Closer inspection revealed that Jones was conducting draft activities from the Bravo Eugenia, according to ESPN investigative reporter Dom Van Natta Jr., who shared a matching photo of the yacht’s interior.
The billionaire Cowboys owner was in a celebratory mood after Dallas landed Oklahoma wide receiver CeeDee Lamb with the 17th pick in the first round. Jones was coy when asked directly about his whereabouts on draft night.
Jones was first linked to the super-yacht in late 2018, when multiple outlets reported he had finalized ownership of the Bravo Eugenia. The yacht was constructed by Dutch company Oceanco and engineered by Lateral Naval Architects.
The Bravo Eugenia’s amenities include a beach club, gym, helipad, massage room and sauna. The ship is 360-feet long and has four decks.
Jones docked the super-yacht in Miami earlier this year ahead of Super Bowl LIV. It is named after Jones’ wife.
The 2020 NFL Draft continues on Friday night and will conclude on Saturday.
