“The partnership really was leveraging our talents and understanding how to operate these platforms safely and efficiently and then working with them to develop actual delivery strategies that make sense and not just for this current pandemic, but for future events and then ultimately down the road,” he said.

“What we wanted to test… was the scalability of engaging the consumer or the professional drone market,” he said. “But then also being able to utilize readily available platforms that our pilots use every single day… Could we utilize those to do delivery? And what we proved is that we could do it and we could do it very efficiently."
“The purpose of this exercise… was to determine what we could do today safely and efficiently that may bring the benefit of drone delivery to the front lines,” he said. “But also learning what we need to do better… whether it's process, policy, training or otherwise.”
