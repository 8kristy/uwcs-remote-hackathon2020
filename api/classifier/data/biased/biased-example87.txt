"I created the app about four years ago," DoNotPay founder Joshua Browder told FOX Business. "At the time, I got a lot of parking tickets. After I received my fifth ticket, I realized you get out of paying these fees pretty easily if you make a reasonable case, but you need a lawyer."

That's when he realized a perfect solution to these kinds of problems would be an app that uses technology to help people fight pricey government and corporate fees. The app's services cost a flat rate of $3 per month.
The app will then generate the tools necessary for the "beginning of this process for users," including "all the filing documents needed to start these claims," Browder said. It also uses scripts and answers to expected questions that the defendant is likely to ask in a small claims court.
Robocall victims can earn up to $3,000 per call for scammers who are eventually caught.
In what Browder said was one of DoNotPay's proudest success stories, the app helped consumers sue Equifax after the consumer credit reporting agency was hit with a massive data breach in September 2017. While Equifax sent in "very expensive lawyers" to argue their case, consumers were using DoNotPay --- and winning.
Most of the app's users range from ages 30 to 40, Browder said, which is surprising considering apps like Venmo attract users who are mostly under 30 years old. DoNotPay is also looking to make adjustments to make the app easier for older users by adding possible features like dictation.
"Hundreds of thousands of people have downloaded DoNotPay and about 30,000 use it monthly," Browder said, adding that the DoNotPay office has a light-up map of the app's users from across the globe.
