The first MLB game played in New York after 9/11 was between the Atlanta Braves and New York Mets just 10 days after the terrorist attack
"Baseball, at that time, played a huge role in the normalcy or the comfort of something that we could hold on to and to know that everything was going to be all right," Ripken reminisced. "So I know that sports plays that role. And I know in particular baseball does."
Ripken reminded everyone how baseball fans wake up every day, wondering what happened the night before, which makes it almost a part of their daily routines.

He is hopeful baseball will return soon "in some form or some shape" since it's such a pastime for America.
