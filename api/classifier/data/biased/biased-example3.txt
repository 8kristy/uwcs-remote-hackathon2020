That means online ordering and curbside pickup has been available, but in-store shopping as well as in-home installation and repairs have not.
"We are returning to the kind of in-home work many customers have been asking for   the kind that fixes what s broken, installs what s missing, and improves the very technology we all need now more than ever," said Best Buy CEO Corie Barry. "Our employees will follow new safety guidelines before, during and after an in-home visit that meet or exceed CDC guidance."
Starting in May, Best Buy will also begin letting some customers who need to make large appliance purchases, into stores to shop by appointment.
Since each customer s appointment will have a dedicated sales associate, there will be a limited number of customers in the store at any one time to ensure appropriate social distancing takes place.
The company has created stringent safety protocols for the new service including, mandatory protective gear for customers and employees, self-health checks of employees and sanitizing of areas after each appointment.
The service will be available in 200 U.S. stores.
