He also accused the Trump administration of “wasting a hell of a lot of money.”
Still, Biden was careful to avoid criticizing Democratic leadership and said he’s in “constant conversation” with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.
“They got what they could get,” he told Politico. “I’ve been in too many negotiations to second-guess anybody else’s.”
The fifth round of legislation, Biden said, should include more forward-looking investments that could help the economy recover from COVID-19, the respiratory illness caused by the virus, once it’s contained.

Biden released a plan at the beginning of March to address the virus, including guaranteeing free COVID-19 tests for those who need it, rushing resources to hospitals and health care workers to ensure they’re equipped to handle the pandemic and creating a fund for paid sick leave, capped out at $1,400 per week, or about $72,800 in annual earnings.
