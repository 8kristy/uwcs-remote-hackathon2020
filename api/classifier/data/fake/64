Victurus Libertas Published on Oct 28, 2016 

The FBI was investigating Anthony Weiner and Kim Dotcom when they found the Israeli pay to play emails on Weiner's computer. It's very serious. The FBI will be charging Hillary Clinton with planning to engage in pay to play after she had won the election. It's technically treason. Weiner was bragging that he had set up the Israeli deal. HRC was to get $100 million for the Clinton Foundation, for increasing Israeli aid by double! That's $38 billion more than today! Huma Abedin helped set the deal up. 


HILLARY GOT SCHLONGED! LOOK WHAT ANTHONY WEINER JUST SHOVED RIGHT BACK IN HER FACE…
