EMP event forthcoming?
You have a work bunker? What is it exactly that you do? Man if the world went to crap, the last thing i would be concerned about is ensuring my employer keeps the loot rolling in lol. In fact if that does go down, im jumping in my truck with a motivational "item" and coming to work to stock up. The mine site has enough food for 500 people a for 2 weeks at a time. I live out in the country. Im On well water, 1000 liter propane tank for heat and out door boiler. The genny is hooked up to a 400 liter gas storage container. My house that im building up the road from my current house already has the solar panels hooked up on a 24 volt system. Everyday, theres a buck or a couple does in the yard. Lots of partridge and bears around if things get rough. Only thing we would be lacking is fresh vegetables over the winter...which could be problematic.
