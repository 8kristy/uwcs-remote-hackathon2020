Finally, my first thread! :)
link Well, that didn't go as planned... Anyway, my first thread so I can indulge. I have to admit, getting to 'here' was not easy, this forum (or my brain) is really different than other places, so hopefully I do this right. I have a thread or two that I have wanted to do, this is my beginning to that. Howdy from Texas too, I have to mention that. edit on 26-10-2016 by recrisp because: (no reason given)
